                <p class="content intro">For this project, we were challenged to dig out problems along a student’s journey from receiving the acceptance letter to the arrival at campus of Carnegie Mellon University(CMU). We were asked to pick up a problem and solve it with a responsive website innovatively. Class Star is the solution we came up with to solve the waitlist problem during course registration for new admitted students. We turned waitlist into exchangable spots and changed the suffering experience into an enjoyable one.</p>

                      <h3 class="keyContent">What’s wrong with the current course registration system?</h3>
                      <p>Students have <span class="strong">difficulties in making decision</span> in course registration, which makes them confused and frustrated. The difficulties are mainly in two aspects: </p>
                      <p> 1) It’s hard to make decision on which course to take due to the lack of course information and feedback from previous students;</p>
                      <p>2) It’s hard to make decision on whether to stay on a course waitlist because students have no idea on the chances that they could get into the course.</p>
                      <p>We kept looking into the two aspects, and found out that the first one could basically be solved through communication with professors and other students. While the second one, waitlist, was the hard one to solve.</p>
                  <h3 class="keyContent long center">Waitlist is the main cause of anixety, because students don’t have much knowledge and control over it.</h3>

                  <p class="content">After several rounds of ideation, we came up with this idea to make the waitlist spots into something exchangeable, and give them “price” by measuring a student’s desire towards the course. The stronger desire a student has, the higher “price” he or she would love to “pay” for the spot.</p>
                  <img class="center diagram" id="systemComparison" src="img/classStar-waitlist-system.jpg">
                      <p>Under the envisioned system, the waitlist follows the following rules:</p>
                      <p><span class="strong">Ordered by preference and use stars to mesuare it.</span> We take out registration time factor out of current system, and instead, order waitlist spots based on students’ preference measured by stars. Each student will be given 10 stars before class registration starts.</p>
                      <p><span class="strong">Droplist and waitlist.</span> We let students know who is considering dropping a course by creating a droplist. Students who have already registered a class but considering dropping it put their names on the drop list, so waitlist students could know their chances of getting into the course.</p>
                      <p><span class="strong">Automatic exchange system.</span> At a certain time of the day, the system will automatically match waitlist students with droplist students based on their relative position. The exchange is daily until the end of course registration period.</p>
                      <p><span class="strong">Chat function.</span> Students on waitlist have no way to know other students’ thoughts or preference towards the course.</p>

                  <p>With the envisioned system in mind, we imagined the future course registration process and made a new future customer journey map, within which no pain points exist during course registration for CMU students.</p>

                  <p><span class="strong">1. Reframing is not only a method, but also an attitude for pushing design.</span> In this project, I first learned how to envision a preferred future with “reframing”, and it greatly changed my way of observing things. As Jon Kolko, the founder of Austin Center for Design, describes, reframing is a method of shifting semantic perspective in order to see things in a new way. It is such a powerful tool to midwife client’s desiderata, which could never been imagined at the beginning, either by client or designer. Besides, reframing should also be used as an attitute across all design stages. Always believe that “I’m working on the wrong thing” and open to all possiblilities would help discover better paths.</p>
              </div>
                  <p><span class="strong">2. Combining two models as design instruction.</span> In this design, we followed two design models: the analysis-synthesis bridge model (left) and the double diamond model (right). I find that combining the two models is a quite effective way to walk through the process, since they instruct me to be aware of where to continuously push and where to stop and make a decision.</p>

                  <p><span class="strong">3. Metaphor of objects should reflect user’s mental model in reality.</span> In this project, we first used badges instead of stars to represent student’s preference. But the feedback we got from students show that badges would cause some confusion, since it represents some kind of accomplishment in most cases. So finally we changed to stars - a more appropriate representation for preference. In our design, everything we use should confirm with users’ mental model and image in real life to reduce users’ mental burden when using our product.</p>
