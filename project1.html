                <p class="content col-lg-4 col-xs-12">For this project, we were challenged to dig out problems along a student’s journey from receiving the acceptance letter to the arrival at campus of Carnegie Mellon University(CMU). We were asked to pick up a problem and solve it with a responsive website innovatively. Class Star is the solution we came up with to solve the waitlist problem during course registration for new admitted students. We turned waitlist into exchangable spots and changed the suffering experience into an enjoyable one.</p>

                  <p class="col-lg-9"><span class="strong">1. Reframing is not only a method, but also an attitude for pushing design.</span> In this project, I first learned how to envision a preferred future with “reframing”, and it greatly changed my way of observing things. As Jon Kolko, the founder of Austin Center for Design, describes, reframing is a method of shifting semantic perspective in order to see things in a new way. It is such a powerful tool to midwife client’s desiderata, which could never been imagined at the beginning, either by client or designer. Besides, reframing should also be used as an attitute across all design stages. Always believe that “I’m working on the wrong thing” and open to all possiblilities would help discover better paths.</p>

Combining two models as design instruction.</span> In this design, we followed two design models: the analysis-synthesis bridge model (left) and the double diamond model (right). I find that combining the two models is a quite effective way to walk through the process, since they instruct me to be aware of where to continuously push and where to stop and make a decision.</p>

So finally we changed to stars - a more appropriate representation for preference. In our design, everything we use should confirm with users’ mental model and image in real life to reduce users’ mental burden when using our product.</p>
